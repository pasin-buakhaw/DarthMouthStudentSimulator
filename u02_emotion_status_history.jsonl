Attending COSC 065 and COSC 077 was a highlight. It\u2019s great to finally start interacting with the material, but I found myself a bit overwhelmed at times, especially with all the upcoming deadlines. I am someone who tends to feel anxious under pressure, and my neuroticism often makes that stress bubble up more than it probably should. Knowing that I have multiple deadlines looming makes it a bit hard to focus fully on what I\u2019m learning. \n\nSocially, I\u2019ve found it a bit challenging to connect with friends this week. I went to the Hopkins Center for the Arts for a performance, which was lovely, but I still felt a bit of distance. I sometimes struggle with reaching out because I often think people are busy or I may be imposing. However, my stamina felt quite good overall, prompting me to push through and not let the week\u2019s challenges completely bring me down.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to balance my study time effectively.

I appreciated the focus and the structure of the class, especially after so much time just wandering around campus aimlessly. The material felt enlightening, and I was reminded of why I\u2019m so passionate about computer science. I also took a moment to hang out at Bartlett Hall after class to reconnect with some classmates, which helped lift my mood a bit.\n\nOn Thursday, I managed to hit the gym, which I felt was a great achievement, especially as I didn't make it a habit lately. It was refreshing to get some physical activity in and felt like a step towards better personal discipline. However, the looming deadlines started to weigh heavily on my mind, and reminders of various projects creeping up definitely added stress. \n\nBy the time the weekend arrived, I was back at the Boathouse and reflecting on how I had fallen into a bit of a rut regarding my motivation and focus. Saturday brought a fleeting sense of productivity when I went to the Admissions Office, but the social aspect continued to feel lacking. I saw my friends around campus, but we didn\u2019t connect as much as I would have liked.\n\nOn Sunday evening, I finally pushed myself to the Fairchild Physical Sciences Center, and it felt good to at least remind myself of my academic goals.

The weeks ahead are going to be demanding, with multiple deadlines. Keeping a proactive approach, I want to start my assignments early and allocate specific times each day for uninterrupted study, ensuring I stay ahead of the curve, which aligns with my conscientious nature.\n\nOverall, while this week brought its set of challenges, it has offered me valuable insights into my routines and the importance of finding harmony between my academic and social life.

I spent a significant amount of time at the Dartmouth College Boathouse, which feels both peaceful and overwhelming sometimes. The early mornings before dawn, though unproductive for study or classwork, offered a moment of stillness that was nice in contrast to the busy atmosphere I found elsewhere. \n\nI had a couple of productive hours in Sudikoff Hall, where my computer science classes are held. I managed to engage with some fascinating topics, but I could feel the pressure of looming deadlines as they approached rapidly. Four of them are due next Monday and Tuesday, which has me a little anxious. I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019ll be able to balance it all while maximizing my knowledge retention. I just need to remind myself that this is what I signed up for \u2013 to challenge myself and grow.\n\nSocially, I didn\u2019t go out much this week. After classes and studying, I found myself a bit too drained to engage with friends or try to meet new people. We have midterms coming up, and the stress is starting to seep into my social life. While it\u2019s not unusual for me to lean more on the introverted side, I\u2019d like to try and reconnect with some friends over the weekend to recharge my social batteries. I know it would help boost my mood, which has been feeling a bit low lately.\n\nAlso, I really want to make some time for physical activity. I went to the Alumni Gymnasium for a gym session, which was refreshing, but I want to keep that up regularly to improve my stamina. The more I can balance my physical and mental health, the better I\u2019ll perform academically.\n\nFor next week, my goals are twofold: I need to ensure I prioritize my assignments and understanding the material for my COSC classes while also carving out time for social interactions and exercise. I believe this balance could help alleviate the stress I\u2019ve been feeling. I\u2019m hopeful that with this conscious effort, I\u2019ll come away feeling more accomplished and socially fulfilled. Fingers crossed!", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: Rated at 40 because the student mentioned feeling drained after classes and that they want to keep up with regular exercise to improve their stamina.

Classes are still in full swing, but I didn\u2019t have any recorded class experience this week, which is unlike me. It\u2019s strange to think about how my schedule feels empty, even though I\u2019ve spent countless hours at Sudikoff Hall and the Boathouse.\n\nOn Wednesday, I was at Sudikoff Hall for an extended period. I didn\u2019t actively engage in class until late afternoon, which has made me feel a bit off. I might be picking up some bad study habits from the pressure of the upcoming deadlines. I managed to converse with a couple of classmates during my time on campus, even if it's just fleeting chats. Still, my social energy feels low; it\u2019s hard to balance everything when I feel this stretched out. It\u2019s almost as if the more I try to engage, the more I retreat into my shell.\n\nThough my knowledge feels solid, with a 85 and an 80 in my respective classes, I worry that I\u2019m not doing enough to foster connections with others. This might be affecting my happiness, which is sitting right at 50. I have this nagging sense of discontent because I want to be more involved, yet I can\u2019t seem to muster the motivation to reach out. \n\nIn terms of balance and personal wellness, I feel fatigued. My sleep is hovering around 35, which is a concerning reality for me. I\u2019ve noticed nodding off during the day, especially when I\u2019m at the Boathouse. Sometimes, I go there to wind down, but even that has become more of a routine than a refreshing escape. With my stamina at 40, I need to seriously revamp how I approach my days.\n\nNext week, my main goal is to manage my time better. I\u2019ll prioritize completing assignments early so I can make space for social interactions, and I\u2019ll try to maintain balance by ensuring I get quality rest. I also want to engage more with classmates during office hours and group study sessions. Social interaction feels daunting, but I know I need it. I hope to inch my happiness back up with these small changes. \n\nReflecting on this week has opened my eyes to the need for a holistic approach to my life here. While academic performance is crucial, so is the social aspect and maintaining mental wellness. I want to keep growing, but I need to be intentional about how I prioritize each aspect moving forward. Here's to a better week ahead!", "judge_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student mentions feeling fatigued and describes their stamina as being at 40.
