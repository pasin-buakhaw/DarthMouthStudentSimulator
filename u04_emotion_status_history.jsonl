It feels like the days passed in a blur, with a lot of time spent at familiar locations, predominantly the Sphinx Secret Society. I find solace there, even if it\u2019s mostly quiet time.\n\nAcademically, I had classes scheduled but didn't have any recorded experiences in them. I can feel a creeping sense of anxiety about upcoming deadlines, particularly those on Monday and Tuesday. Those nights can get stressful, especially when they stack up together with various assignments. I need to find a way to manage my time better and not get overwhelmed as deadlines approach. I might benefit from breaking the assignments into smaller tasks and starting them earlier in the week; it could relieve some of that pressure.\n\nOn the plus side, I did attend a pottery session at the Davidson Pottery Studio, which was a lovely break from all the stress of academic life. It felt great to create something with my hands, rather than just sitting in lecture halls or studying. I need to remind myself of the importance of these little escapes. \n\nI also spent time at the boathouse, which was refreshing. I wish I had a bit more social engagement, though. I felt somewhat detached from social activities this week, even if my social score seems neutral. I kept finding my evenings at Sphinx or in my dorm instead of with friends. I think I need to push myself to engage more with people. Perhaps next week, I could invite someone along to the pottery studio or a study group.\n\nLooking ahead, my goals for next week are to stay on top of my assignments, carve out dedicated time for studying friends, and keep the balance by allowing time for creative outlets like pottery. I also want to connect with classmates to participate in group studies or projects and maybe even create a study schedule with peers. I can feel my energy waning when I don\u2019t engage, and it\u2019s time to shake things up a bit. If I can manage my responsibilities and my social life better, I could find a way to feel more fulfilled as a student while avoiding that tightening anxiety.", "judge_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student indicated feeling drained when not engaging socially, suggesting some depletion of energy, yet they participated in a pottery session and spent time at the boathouse, which likely refreshed them. Hence, a score of 80 signifies good stamina but not optimal.\n  \n- **Knowledge**: The student mentioned having classes but felt no notable experiences in them, indicating a moderate engagement with their studies. Thus, a score of 60 reflects an average grasp on academic content.\n\n- **Stress**: The student expressed a \"creeping sense of anxiety\" about upcoming deadlines and the stress associated with managing multiple assignments. With these concerns, a stress score of 70 captures their heightened anxiety level.\n\n- **Happy**: Attending the pottery session was noted as a \"lovely break\" and helped them feel good. However, the overall tone reflected mixed feelings due to the balance of obligations and anxiety, leading to a balanced happy score of 60.\n\n- **Sleep**: They did not mention any sleep issues and ended the week with goals to manage responsibilities better, which suggests that they have managed their sleep well. A score of 90 reflects a healthy sleep state.\n\n- **Social**: The student expressed a desire for more social engagement and felt somewhat detached from friends, indicating a lower social involvement despite spending time in familiar places. A score of 40 effectively represents this need for greater social interaction."}

I didn't have any classes recorded, but I did manage to squeeze in some time at the Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center and the Boathouse, which always brings me a sense of comfort and familiarity, even if it\u2019s not strictly tied to my studies. \n\nI've been spending quite a lot of time at the Sphinx Secret Society\u2014a strange choice, I know, but it seems to be where I gravitate when I\u2019m feeling a bit overwhelmed or disconnected from my academics. It\u2019s a space where I feel somewhat at home, but spending hours in there without any real interaction with others has made me feel rather isolated. My social life has definitely taken a hit, with only a 40 on that front, and honestly, I think it's weighing on my mind more than I\u2019d like to admit. Amid all this, my emotional state isn\u2019t awful\u2014I still feel at least 60% happy, so that\u2019s a plus.\n\nSpeaking of emotional states, I notice that my neuroticism is acting up\u2014I'm often anxious about those looming deadlines. It seems like every time I check my schedule, there are more assignments waiting for me. With deadlines approaching on both Monday and Tuesday, I feel the pressure mounting. I need to find a balance between focusing on my tasks and allowing myself to socialize. \n\nLooking ahead, my goals for next week are pretty straightforward: I want to make it a priority to attend class and engage with my peers. Strengthening my connections would hopefully help improve my social percentage and, in turn, my feel-good levels. I also aim to break out of my isolation by spending less time in the Sphinx Society and more time at social events or group study sessions, where I can combine both study and socializing. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve got a plan in mind and a few things I\u2019d like to accomplish next week. Here\u2019s hoping those goals help alleviate some of this anxiety and open up a little more joy in my routine.", "judge_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n- **Stamina**: I rated this at 70 because the student mentioned spending a lot of time at various places, which shows they are actively engaging, even without classes. However, this can also lead to some fatigue, as they feel drained from isolation, so it's not at maximum.\n- **Knowledge**: I kept this at 60 since the student did not attend any classes but spent time in environments associated with learning. There were no clear indications of acquiring new knowledge this week.\n- **Stress**: The stress level is high at 80 due to the student's feelings of anxiety about upcoming deadlines and the pressure related to assignments. They specifically noted the pressure mounting as assignments pile up, indicating a considerable amount of stress.\n- **Happy**: This was set to 60 as the student mentioned they feel at least 60% happy. Although they find some comfort in familiar places, the overall mix of feelings such as anxiety and isolation tempers their happiness.\n- **Sleep**: I rated this at 90, as the student did not indicate any issues with sleep and implied a stable routine by attending to their feelings and reflections.\n- **Social**: This is at 40 based on the student's admission of feeling isolated and having a hit social life. While they plan to improve this by aiming to socialize more next week, their current interactions are minimal."}

I know I have a mix of assignments due Monday and Tuesday, and I can't shake off this nagging anxiety that creeps in when I think about completing them on time. \n\nOn a brighter note, I spent a good amount of time at the Sphinx Secret Society and the Fairchild Physical Sciences Center this week, which was comforting in a way. It\u2019s a space where I can think and recharge, though I can\u2019t help but notice how often I find myself spending time there alone. My social meter is only at 40, and I feel torn between wanting to connect with friends and the pressure of schoolwork. The struggle to reach out and engage socially is palpable, especially when it seems like everyone else is so busy.\n\nI did manage to go out to the Nugget Theater on Thursday, though. Watching a movie was a nice escape, and it helped distract me from my thoughts for just a moment. The Boathouse has also become a frequent hangout spot for me over the weekend; there's something relaxing about being by the water, even if it's only to enjoy the view alone.\n\nLooking ahead, I really want to prioritize balancing my social life with my studies. I need to carve out time to connect with friends, maybe even invite a few to join me for study sessions. I also want to establish a clearer schedule for completing my assignments, so I don\u2019t feel overwhelmed by approaching deadlines. As daunting as it sounds, tackling these challenges head-on would certainly help alleviate some of the anxiety I\u2019m feeling right now.\n\nOverall, while I\u2019m feeling okay, a consistent underlying tension remains. I hope by being more proactive in my social engagements and establishing a better routine, I can create a more positive week ahead.", "judge_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n- **Stamina**: I chose 65 because the student expressed feeling drained by the pressure of assignments and deadlines. Although they mention being able to recharge at certain places, the underlying context suggests fatigue.\n  \n- **Knowledge**: I assigned a value of 55 since the student did not log experiences from a particular class (COSC 065), which indicates they may not be absorbing as much knowledge as they could be. Their mention of the pressure to complete assignments reflects a struggle to stay on top of coursework.\n\n- **Stress**: The stress level is high (85) due to the student feeling a \"nagging anxiety\" about looming deadlines and being overwhelmed by the amount of work. Their self-acknowledged struggle with anxiety about timely completion directly reflects this high level of stress.\n\n- **Happy**: I rated happiness at 70 because the student has enjoyed moments of escape, such as watching a movie at the Nugget Theater and spending time at relaxing locations. Despite the underlying tension, they find comfort in certain activities which enhances their happiness.\n\n- **Sleep**: A value of 85 was selected for sleep, as there is no mention of sleep issues or fatigue affecting it. The student reflects positively on their experiences, which often correlate with better sleep quality.\n\n- **Social**: The social score is low (40) due to the student feeling isolated and spending time alone, coupled with a desire to connect with friends but feeling pressured by schoolwork. Their acknowledgment of the disconnect between wanting to engage socially and feeling overwhelmed supports this lower social score."}

That said, I know I need to buckle down on assignments with several deadlines approaching on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nI found myself visiting the Sphinx Secret Society quite a bit during the early hours \u2013 it seems to be a strange comfort zone for me. Maybe it\u2019s the allure of the mysteries surrounding it, or perhaps it feels like a safe retreat where I can ponder my thoughts in solitude. But it does make me reflect on how disconnected I am from my peers; even though I\u2019m spending time around people at various locations, I\u2019m still feeling quite isolated socially, with my social energy floating around 40. The atmosphere feels a bit stifling sometimes, especially when I see others forming their bonds and having fun.\n\nHowever, I did manage to have some moments where I broke out of my routine. My visit to the Boathouse and Baker-Berry Library felt refreshing. I got this little surge of happiness knowing I was immersed in an academic environment, yet at the same time, a cloud of anxiety creeps up as responsibilities pile on. I think my neuroticism has been flaring up, worrying about all the deadlines that are coming up and my ability to meet them.\n\nI also had some physical activity on Tuesday at Leverone Field House, which was a nice change of pace from my mostly sedentary week. The little exercise did wonders for my stamina, making me feel less fatigued along with my good sleep score. It also made me realize how much I need to balance my academic life with some physical activity\u2014it\u2019s like a reset button for my mind.\n\nNext week, I really want to focus on managing my deadlines more effectively.

I aimed for balance, but social interactions took a hit, which is probably why my social score dipped to forty. It's tough when deadlines stack up. I could feel that familiar pang of anxiety creeping in too, especially with six upcoming deadlines already on my mind. It definitely raises that neuroticism factor in me.\n\nSomething I was really proud of this week was finally stepping out of my comfort zone and attending a session at Davidson Pottery Studio. I\u2019ve always wanted to try pottery, and connecting my desire for creativity with a new social setting was invigorating. It provided a little distraction from my usual routine, which tends to bog me down mentally.\n\nFor next week, I definitely need to focus more on managing my time better.

I need to remember to set aside chunks of time for studying, perhaps right after I visit the Boathouse to keep that calming effect with me. I also want to try to be more social.
